- **Visual editing** - Edit your content with a visual interface
- **Markdown support** - Write content in Markdown or MDX
- **Git-based** - All content is stored in your Git repository
- **Customizable** - Extend and customize as needed

## Getting Started

1. Start the development server with `npm start`
2. Navigate to `/admin` in your browser
3. Select this post from the content list

- Add more blog posts and documentation
- Deploy your site to Cloudflare Pages

Happy editing!
