# Introduction to Tinasaurus

Welcome to the Tinasaurus documentation! This guide will help you get started with your Docusaurus site integrated with TinaCMS.

## What is Tinasaurus?

Tinasaurus combines the power of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (a modern static website generator) with [TinaCMS](https://tina.io/) (a headless content management system). This integration provides:

- **Visual editing** - Edit your content with a visual interface
- **Markdown support** - Write content in Markdown or MDX
- **Git-based** - All content is stored in your Git repository
- **Customizable** - Extend and customize as needed

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This will start both Docusaurus and TinaCMS. You can access:
